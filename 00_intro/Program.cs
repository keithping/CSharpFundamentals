            //The universal term for an object in C# is POCO
            //POCO stands for Plain Old CLR Object
            //CLR stands for Common Language Runtime
            //Methods (sometimes called functions) will be behaviors of an object
            //Properties will be nouns of an object
            //There are four pillars of an object oriented programming language:
            //Encapsulation
                //access modifiers
                //the most important part of Encapsulation is privacy (like public or private)
            //Abstraction
            //Inheritance
            //Polymorphismca
